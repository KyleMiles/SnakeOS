SnakeOS
=======

This is some of my earliest code that I still have saved and that I will upload.
This code is from a few years ago (date: ~Summer 2013).

This code is based off of a tutorial that I was following online, here:  http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html

I eventually stopped working on this project (only during the bootloader stage) due to what I found to be major discrepancies in what I was reading, mainly to do with the age of the material I was working with.  I do eventually plan to revive this project and make some sembalance of a working OS, but for now, this is benched.

Just a simple operating system, made completely in 64-bit assembly.
